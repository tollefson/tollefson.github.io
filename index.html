	I gave a presentation to the KLUG Linux user's group June 12, 2014.  A copy of the slides with notes is available on github.  <a href="tollevex/AViewToAVex.pdf">AViewToAView.pdf</a></p>

	You can find the source at the <a href="https://github.com/tollefson/tollevex">tollevex github site</a>.  Or if you would like to try out a beta version and not have to build it yourself you can find here a <a href="tollevex/TolleVex.apk">pre-built version<a>.
